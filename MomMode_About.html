				<h1>Just a Mom on a Mission!</h1>
				<hr>
				<br>
				<p>Hi, I'm Brittney - a mom, just like you - and I created this app because I get it.</p>
				<p>After having a baby, I looked in the mirror and barely recognized myself. I was exhausted, overwhelmed, and felt like my bogy wasn't mine anymore. I loved being a mom, but I missed feeling confident, strong, and like <i>me</i> again.</p>
				<p>I wasn't chasing perfection. I just wanted to feel good in my own body - to have more energy, to move with ease, and to look in the mirror and smile again. But I didn't have hours to spend at the gym or time for complicated meal prep.</p>
				<p>So I started small.</p>
				<p>Simple, nourishing meals. Journaling to stay motivated and mindful. It wasn't easy, but it was real - and it worked. From a size 180.2 lbs. to 163.4 lbs. in less than a month. Almost 20 lbs. down! No skipping meals. No sugarless treats. No working out. The plan was to start working out once I’ve hit 150 lbs. Once I did, the real challenge began. Being able to make time to workout. Whether it be at home or in the gym. I had to make time, out of my busy mom schedule, for me.</p>
				<p>That’s why I created this app – not for fitness experts or influencers, but for <b>real moms</b>. Moms who are juggling babies, work, laundry, and everything in between. Moms who just want to feel better, get stronger, eat healthier, and maybe fit back into their favorite jeans.</p>
				<p>This isn’t about pressure or perfection – it’s about support, small steps, and showing up for you.</p>
				<p>You've got this, Mama!</p>
				<p>With love,</p>
