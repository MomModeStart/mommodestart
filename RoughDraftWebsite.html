	<p>Picking the right type of dog for your type of living situation can be difficult. You have to keep in mind what type of <span class="boldtext">evironment</span> works best for each breed. You also have to keep in mind how much <span class="boldtext">time</span> you need to spend to be able to give that dog the best life possible.</p>
	<p>That said, different breeds require different needs. For big types they require more room for their big bodies to run and play in. For smaller breeds they don't need as much space but do require lots of attention.</p>
	<p><span class="boldtext italic">Here is a short list of some small but active dogs.</span></p>
	<ul>
		<li>American Hairless Terrier</li>
		<li>Austrailian Terrior</li>
		<li>Bolognese</li>
		<li>Boarder Terrier</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Type of Home</h2>	

	<img src="pictures/backyard.jpg" alt="Playing in Backyard" class="center" style="width:600px;height:400px">

	<p>One very important question you need to ask yourself, while choosing a dog, is <span class="italic">"What type of household do I have?"</span> Do you have a small studio apartment? A 2 bedroom apartment? A house in the suburbs? Or even a 2 story house? This question helps limit the dog breeds that wouldn't be suitable in certain homes. For example, smaller homes would eliminate big dog breeds.</p>
	<p>Another question that would help is the size of your backyard. Is it big enough for a large dog to run around and let out their energy? If your backyard is small and you want a large dog, is their a dog park nearby that you could take them to? These questions mainly focus around larger breeds because they require larger spaces to let out their energy. Not to say some smaller dog breeds don't require large areas to play in.</p>
	<p>Some small dogs are super active and also require large spaces as the bigger breeds do. Other smaller dogs could live just about anywhere, as long as they are given attention.</p>
	<p><span class="boldtext italic">Here are some things you will need if you're bringing home a new dog for the family.</span></p>
	<ol>
		<li>Collar</li>
		<li>Leash</li>
		<li>Dog Brush</li>
		<li>Nail Clippers</li>
		<li>Dog Bowls</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Type of Household</h2>
	
	<a href="https://resources.sdhumane.org/Resource_Center/Behavior_and_Training/Dogs_and_Puppies/Dog_Bite_Prevention/Safety%3A_Dogs_and_Young_Children">
	<img src="pictures/family_dog.jpg" alt="Family Outing" class="center" style="width:600px;height:400px">
	</a>

	<p>What type of household do you have? Are you a couple looking for your fur baby? Do you have children or plan to have? Are there babies and toddlers in the house? Are there teens and other adults? Is there always someone in the house who could walk or play with the dog? These questions are for both large and small breeds. All dogs need and require attention almost all the time. Just like babies and little kids. Every dog gets cuddly and want to be close to their owner. Are you someone who wants their space? Maybe look for a breed who can be trained to not get into your personal bubble.</p>
	<p>The type of household you have could also help in eliminating a good portion of breeds to help you find your perfect dog. Because they require lots of attention, you should also ask yourself if you have enough time in your daily routine to take your pet on walks or go out to play. Dogs aren't just fancy statues that you can keep in your house, they are living beings that need to be cared for and looked after. So just keep these things in mind when searching for the new member of your family.</p>

	<h3>Adoption</h3>
